# Youtube upvotes tracker (scrapper)
Did it ever occour to you that you were participating on a contest in which the winners will be selected based on the number of upvotes on youtube videos? And did you ever noticed that other teams bought votes? I wrote this simple script for exactly those times. 
I didn't generalize the code, nor did I manage to find the time to make it run in the background (next weekend... maybe), so take it as is. 

### What you can do with these:
* findnewTeams.ipynb: Crawl a website (the competition page with all the youtube videos embeded on it) and extract the team names and youtube url into a csv file.
* scrapperBS4.ipynb: go fetch youtube likes for all valid url's on the csv file (use .ipynb if you want to play around with the code.
